Lighthouse has been a constant source of challenge for me in my walk. As I continue to grow I am encouraged by the commitment to following the Word closely. This has challenged to make sure that everything that I have can be justified and grounded in Scripture. A significant part of Meditations is influenced largely in LBC. I cannot stress how much Lighthouse as a church as influenced me as a believer in the four eventual years that I will have been here. Praise God that He has led me to this church during my time in college and grad school. Being able to openly discuss about the Word and have similar convictions have been very helpful in continuing to advance the Gospel through out every faucet of our lives. LBC has definitely made a lasting impact on me that I will continue to carry throughout my trek on this Earth. Praise God for using LBC!
