I think that there are many different avenues that I can continue to serve. Whether that is overseas in working with other languages in cultures. Or to first get more formal training in areas of leadership and biblical knowledge so that I can work more effectively. The avenues are many but there are a few ideas that I have in mind: taking care of family, increasing in Christian disciplines in outreach in my immediate life, and finally learning more by doing more.

I am not sure where I am headed. But what I am starting to slowly see is my strengths and my weaknesses. What I will try to do is to continue to be sharpened my local church as I continue to serve and to learn form others. Thoughts about DTS and long term missions are still up in the air but will continue to pray about these things.
