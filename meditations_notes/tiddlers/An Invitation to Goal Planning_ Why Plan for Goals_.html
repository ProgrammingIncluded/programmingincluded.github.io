As many people know, I am currently a Master's student at UCSD in Computer Science.
Each quarter, I am bombarded with emails, events, homework, classes, family, other people's homeworks, and research.

Recently, I am learning the need for physical rest because if I don't, things go down south quick! But yet not mistaking it for a spiritual rest.
Needless to say, I am in a different stage of life and I am sure many others older or even younger than me are well familiar with this lifestyle that I yet to fully understand.

Amidst all of this, however, is the lingering question: 

''What trajectory should I orientate my life and what are my priorities?''

I remember two years ago, I was introduced to the book: __Found: God's Will__ by John ~MacArthur. In it, ~MacArthur mentions 5 key points that are necessary to know the direction that God wants for your life:

''Saved, Spirit-filled, Sanctified, Submissive, and Suffering''

In the book, he mentions that once you are striving for the five points you can do what you want because what you want will should be what God will be directing you.
My focus, will be on this notion: 

	''Once I have and am striving to following the five points, what are some good ways to go about knowing what I want? In other words, what are some good ways to plan ahead?''

In order for me to take a step, I need to first know what direction to take lest I find myself in the notion of going straight into a brick wall of folly.
One might say, "perhaps that brick wall was necessary." In which I respond, “perhaps it is for the uninitiated and uninformed!” Here is my argument:

	''I do think that there are Scriptural wisdom that we can further apply to know the first step to take that is God glorifying in our walk with Him.''


What I am about to write and reference Scripturally are not my own ideas.
During my backpacking trip, I had a great opportunity to fellowship and ask deep questions regarding trajectories that I had in life with those who have walked longer than me and more training than me.
In the trip, I was recommended a book by those wiser and far more knowledgeable than me:
__The Juggling Act__ by Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger is quiet a solid Christian who used to be the vice president of Intel and is now the CEO of VMWare.

Now there requires a side note. This book has many anecdotes. But hopefully one understands anecdotes are there to illustrate the Scriptural points pointed out by the author. Is it possible that certain actions in the experience are debatable, of course.
Furthermore, upon deeper analysis, one will find that this book is written in such a way that you have to do the Scripture digging and Bible reading.
It simply points out the principles of Scripture and what the author does upon studying them with practical anecdotes.

I think that understanding the parables of minas in Luke 19:24 points us to the notion of investing in our talents or skills that God gives us in this life.
John 15:8 where we are praised for bearing fruit and Proverbs 31 as biblical notions of planning ahead for the Proverbs 31 woman.
The notion of numbering your days come in too!

Gelsinger particular layout three categories of planning that he recommends: 

* Mission
* Values
* Goals

How I saw it was:

* Mission: vision planned from current talents and abilities from the notion of Spiritual gifts/resources given.
* Values: important character qualities and passages to continuously follow from the integrity/testimony of Christian living.
* Goals: current desires to pursue down the line while in the 5 points that ~MacArthur outlines.

I think that these recommendations are really helpful for me. Here is the example from the book. Each point and line is deeply ingrained in Scriptural backing and support. It takes a lot of prayer and effort to go about writing down the planning!

Again, these three categories are merely suggestions, not necessary for every believer.
But I do think that the notions of plannings and having goals in our plans is not only helpful but a very natural practical method of Christian living.

Thus here is my question for discussion:
	What does everyone think about this notion of goal and planning as Christians? Not just having some fuzzy notion of what to do, but seriously consider, pray, hash out, and write out what we can. Spending deep time in the Word and really asking God about these priorities in life are for each one of us.

My invitation is for my fellow young men in the church: would you like to join me to spend some time to really pray about and to meditate on your goals in life?
I think it would be very helpful to, come together, in the end, to really discuss what did we have in our plans? What are really the Scriptures that motivate those desires?
If so, let's find a time to meet up after we have done our own work to really sharpen one another through the Word and the strengths and weaknesses we see in each other.
Just PM or something :)

I do think that as young men we are called to be leaders and teachers. Having a goal helps to know where you are headed, how to lead in marriage, how to lead your kids, and even who to date.

There are couple closing remarks that I would like to end to demonstrate the application of really sitting down and planning.
Ravi Zacharias in his forum: __The Problem of Pleasure__, mentions some very helpful principles in viewing pleasures that I don't have time to get into.
I am not sure how much are firmly Scriptural but some of them are definitely supported through Scripture of which I will mention here one:

Principle 1: Anything that refreshes you without distracting you to the final goal is a legitimate pleasure (another view of idolatry).

Take this rule: whatever weakens your reason, impairs the tenderness of your conscience, obscures your sense of God, or takes off your relish of spiritual things; in short, whatever 
increases the strength and authority of your body over your mind, that thing is sin to you, however innocent it may be in itself.

Susanna Wesley (Mother of John Wesley)

Having spiritual goals allow us to measure how much time we should prioritize in our rest and pleasures.
It helps to know that video games are not inherently wrong and so often we emphasize that. But what is the gauge by which we know when to stop?

As Christians we should not be easily swayed by what others view us or by simple human approval. Our assurance is based off Scripture first and encouraged by our church brethren. Not the other way around.


Finally, one might ask the question about the great commission: Isn't our goal to satisfy the great commission? Or another form, our church has our own mission statements, does it not?

To answer this, I think the key is that this planning is uniquely for you, not anyone else that relates to how the church body functions. As we know, the church is composed of different body parts. Each person in the church has their own unique gifts and abilities. This planning should fall under the great commission, but more focused on what you can do in the great commission.
The goals should not deter you from having a heart to learn and exploring new skills sets to see what gifts one may have (perhaps part of your goals too!).
