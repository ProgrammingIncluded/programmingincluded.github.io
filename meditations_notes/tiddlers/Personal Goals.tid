As a writer and owner of the notebook, here are the goals that I set myself to follow in my Christian walk. Reasoning can be found in the tiddler: [[An Invitation to Goal Planning: Why Plan for Goals?]]

''Mission:''

"""
To be a Christian steward, minister, and friend.
Seek in the growth and character to resemble more and more like Christâ€™s likeness.
To enable, support, and teach the people of God through the Word whenever possible.
To share the Gospel whenever possible in the domain of personal life, work life, and church life.
"""

''Values:''

* Apply the Word whenever I can as I learn. (James 2:22; Hebrews 5:14)
* Seek diligently the Word of God and to have a perspective on what I should learn on this Earth. To pursue understanding. (Psalm 32:8-9; Hebrews 12:11)
* Show no partiality. (James 2:1)
* Quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger. (James 1:19)
* Receive the Word with meekness. (James 1:21)
* Hunger and thirst for righteousness. (Matthew 5:6)
* Fear the Lord and no one or nothing else. (Isaiah 8:12-13)
* In times of distress, in high points, low points, to pursue God and worship in Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. (Colossians 3:16)
* Lovingly, with wisdom, point out other Christian's sins and help them grow in Christ. (Mark 10:17-22; Jude 17-23)


''Goals:''

* Provide support both physically and spiritually for my mom.
* Work on diligently pursuing steadfastness in prayer. 
* Memorize at least 1 significant verse that impacted me per week.
* Work on knowing when to be strong tempered and low tempered in order to work with all different types of people for aiding them in their walk with God.
* Keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight for the Kingdom.
* Work on my fear and anxiety of man by challenging myself to minister in positions that will exalt Christ and decrease myself.
* Work on writing down insights to what I have learned through Scripture through note booking.
* Strive to focus investing on at least one thing that has eternal impact each day.
