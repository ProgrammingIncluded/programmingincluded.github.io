In the design lab that I research at, we often talk about the concept of going through the interation process.
<br /> <br />
When working on a project, often times we do not know the exact final product, however, we know the needs from the client.
So much of the things we have today, we take for granted.
I think this video illustrates this point very well. I have always been very greatful for Handmade Con. 
For Muratori to take the history of computer graphics and explain with clarity. The Handmade Con lives with this spiriti in mind.
<br /> <br />
I recommend checking out this video when anyone has the chance. It talks a lot about tinkering around with unknowns and trying to figure out what to do.
Furthermore, the video mentions something very interesting: the theory picked up after the design.
The people who were working with texture mapping were prototyping more and worrying less about the math.
This is a lot with the mentality of research. Calculus was invented as a process to describe Physics. Vice versa.
