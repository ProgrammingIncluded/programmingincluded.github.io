            <h2> About Me </h2>
            Charles received his Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the age of 18 at the University of California San Diego. He is now a first year master's student at UCSD.
            <br /><br />
            He works in the <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/">UCSD Design Lab</a>, working under <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/">Philip Guo</a> in designing HCI systems to better aid in CS education.
            <br />
            In the past, Charles has also worked under the San Diego Super Computer Center with Beth Simon and Illkay Altintas in developing the Big Data Course
            on Coursera under UCSD. He has also worked alongside the San Diego School District in improving the implementation of the AP Computer Science curriculum, working closely with teachers and
            faculty in understanding student needs and how they can be better addressed through online technologies.
            <br /> <br />
            He has personally worked with non-profit and profit organizations in website design, event portfolios, system directories, and patent arduino hardware/software design.
            <br /><br />

            His interests are anything that invovles creativity. Concept art design, music composing, theoretical math, machine learning, and game programming all fall into this realm.
            For more hobby oriented discussion, please refer to his up and comming ProgrammingIncluded blog.
