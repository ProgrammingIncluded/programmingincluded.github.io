Charles now works at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/" class=nvgreen>NVIDIA</a> as a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt" class=nvgreen>TensorRT</a> backend developer. <br/><br/> In the past, Charles worked at the <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu/">UCSD Design Lab</a>, under <a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/">Philip Guo</a> in designing HCI systems to better aid in CS education. Charles has also worked at the San Diego Super Computer Center under Beth Simon and Illkay Altintas in developing UCSD's Big Data Course on Coursera. He has also worked alongside San Diego School District in improving the implementation of the AP Computer Science curriculum, working closely with teachers and faculty in understanding student needs and how they can be better addressed through online technologies. <br/> <br/> He has personally worked with non-profit and profit organizations in website design, event portfolios, system directories, and patent arduino hardware/software design. </div> <div id=general_direction> <h2> Trajectory </h2> Life is not only about work. Charles has several overarching goals and direction in life: <br/><br/> <div class=indent> <b>He has deep desires to help developing countries.</b> Having recently gone to a developing Middle Eastern country as a CS teacher, Charles has been deeply interested in teaching or introducing technological aid to other countries. He is looking more into how to better serve in this area. <br/><br/> <b>His interests are anything that involves creativity.</b> Concept art design, music composing, theoretical math, machine learning, and game programming all fall into this realm. For more hobby oriented discussion, please refer to the <i>Programming Included Blog</i>. </div> </div> <div id=channel> <h2>Livestreaming</h2> Charles occasionally livestreams his own works in both programming for hobby related works and his non-programming related interests. The archives can be found under Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKn41nXaezqhllnC_uDRBpg">ProgrammingIncluded</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtEwnBIEgdzH3dDjRW82pOg">SKKMelody</a> respectfully. </div> <div id=talks> <h2>Talks</h2> June 2019 - <i>Improv: Teaching Programming at Scale</i> @ <b>Qualcomm, SD</b> </div> <div id=papers> <h2>Papers</h2> <b><a href="../pdf/Improv-live-coding-in-slide-presentations_LAS-2019.pdf">Improv: Teaching Programming at Scale via Live Coding.</a> </b> Charles Chen and Philip J.
