    I am starting this section of the site in order to meditate on the Word. Nothing more, nothing less.
I was given counsel that I should write down these things as I study and meditate on the Word of God.
My goal is not to write about myself or my personal achievements. Rather I would like to focus on WHO God is and HOW God works in my life.
I ask for the reader to hold me accountable. Meditations should be glorifying to God. Please let me know if this is not the case and we can discuss about it.
I pray that this site will be edifying to the body and engage conversations with those who do not identify as Christians to talk about who Christ is.
<br /> <br />

This site is kept as a seperate entity from ProgrammingIncluded because ProgrammingIncluded is a site meant as a portfolio.
I am still thinking about whether or not it would be wise to include this blog as linked to PI. I need to pray and think more about this.
